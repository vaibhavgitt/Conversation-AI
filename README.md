# Chat with your PDFs

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for
Chat with your PDFs.
This is a simple app that allows you to chat with multiple PDFs. You can upload your PDFs to the app, and it will extract the text from the PDFs and create a conversation chain. You can then ask the conversation chain questions about your documents, and it will try to answer your questions.

### Here is an example of how to use the app:

1. Upload your PDFs to the app.
2. Ask the conversation chain a question about your documents.
3. The conversation chain will try to answer your question.


For example, you could ask the conversation chain "What is the main topic of this document?" or "What are the key takeaways from this document?"

The conversation chain will use the text from your PDFs to answer your questions. It will also use a model called ChatAnthropic or model of your choice to generate responses.
